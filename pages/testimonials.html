            <h3>Michelle Anderson (Course Lecturer - IT: Front-end Developer)</h3>
            <p>Matthew was one of my students in the course IT: Front-end Developer during the spring semester 2023 at Sundsgården Folkhögskola. 
                During the course, it was obvious that Matthew had a deep desire to learn and understand code. 
                I could tell from the start that Matthew was eager to learn as much as possible and to really dive deep into the world of code. 
                He often completed his assignments quickly and with good quality code. Matthew is a fast learner, 
                and I could see in his projects that he invested a lot of time in learning more advanced topics and practice the basics we covered in the course. 
                With each assignment, Matthew’s code got better and better, and I could see that he understood and learned from his previous mistakes. 
                He faced every challenge and obstacle with a smile and a positive attitude. It has been my pleasure to be a part of his programming journey and I hope our paths cross again in the future. 
                I wish him all the best as he continues his journey within IT.</p>
